# Rossmann-Store-Sales
Rossmann Store sales predicition using deep neural network

**Problem Statement**
Rossmann is one of the largest drugstore chains in Germany, with operations across Europe. As of 2018, they have well over 3,900 stores in Europe with an annual
turnover of 9 billion euros. Our task is to predict the sales for a few identified stores on a given day.

The link to kaggle dataset:" **www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data** "

The code is divided into few parts:
1)Data Exploration
2)Data Visualization
3)Feature Engineering
4)Designing the model
    Rules followed:
    i)Starting with small architectures
    ii)When small architectures fail, increase the size 
    iii)When larger networks with two layers fail, increase the size
    iv)When larger and deeper networks also fail,a larger and deeper network is made
    v)When everything fails, revisit the data.
 5)Making Predicitions
